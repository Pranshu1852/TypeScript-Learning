# TypeScript Modules

## How JavaScript Modules are Defined
A file without any top-level import or export declarations is treated as a script whose contents are available in the global scope (and therefore to modules as well).

Modules are executed within their own scope, not in the global scope. This means that variables, functions, classes, etc. declared in a module are not visible outside the module unless they are explicitly exported using one of the export forms. Conversely, to consume a variable, function, class, interface, etc. exported from a different module, it has to be imported using one of the import forms.

## Non-modules
It’s important to understand what TypeScript considers a module. The JavaScript specification declares that any JavaScript files without an import declaration, export, or top-level await should be considered a script and not a module.

Inside a script file variables and types are declared to be in the shared global scope, and it’s assumed that you’ll either use the outFile compiler option to join multiple input files into one output file, or use multiple <script> tags in your HTML to load these files (in the correct order!).
